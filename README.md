# RandomNameGenerator
This .NET Core library will allow you to create random names based off of U.S. Census data.
When you need to populate a database with test data this is a great tool to use, it works well for games that need to generate random names for NPC Characters

There are three projects in this solution

## RandomNameGenerator
The actual library that handles the data and name generator

## RandomNameGeneratorTests
The project that contains the unit tests for the library

## ConsoleTestNameGenerator
A very simple console application to demonstrate the library
